Sorting Algorithm Visualizer


The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive graphical application designed to visualize the process of various common sorting algorithms. Users can select different algorithms and observe the sorting process step-by-step, enhancing their understanding of how these algorithms work.

Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: 

Bubble Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
And more!

Technologies Used
-Rust: The programming language used to build the application.
-eframe: A lightweight GUI framework built on egui for creating the application interface.
-egui: An immediate-mode GUI library used for rendering and handling the user interface.
-rand: A library used to generate random arrays for sorting.
-Multithreading: Sorting algorithms run in the background using std::thread to maintain a responsive user interface.
